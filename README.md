# Event_Management_System 
### IN Postgres, MySQL, Oracle

## Concept:
    Consider I have 10 halls or places with different capacities that I can give rental to some Organisations to conduct their events like conferences, workshops and so on. 

## Tables I have:
1. Venue.
2. Organisations.
3. Events.
4. Staffs.
5. Tasks.

*Venue* - have the list of places or halls in my case with different capacities.

*Organisations* - have the list of Organisations. Since I've created this as a Mini-Project. I hardcoded the organisation. You can get Organisations with registration.

*Events* - have the list of events that are going to held and their details.

*Staffs* - have list of staff we have. Each staff will be allocated to the events they have to get the event kept going.

*Tasks* - this have the list of task and their status. to keep the track of tasks for the event.
